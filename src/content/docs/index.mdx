# attn/ui

attn/ui is a small, curated collection of UI components.
It exists to explore how careful decisions shape better interfaces.

This is not a catalog.
It is a body of work.

## Why this exists

Most UI libraries optimize for coverage.
attn/ui optimizes for intention.

Components are added only when there is something worth saying — a clearer API, a better interaction, or a more thoughtful default.

If a component does not express a point of view, it does not belong here.

## Taste over completeness

attn/ui does not aim to solve every UI problem.

There will be fewer components than expected.
Some common primitives may never appear.

Absence is intentional.
Restraint is part of the craft.

## Authored, not assembled

Every component in attn/ui is treated as authored work.

Patterns may be familiar, but implementations are reconsidered.
APIs are shaped deliberately.
Motion is tuned, not added by default.

A component is only shipped when it feels inevitable — not just functional.

## Motion as communication

Animation exists to explain change.

Motion in attn/ui:
- Clarifies state transitions
- Guides attention
- Reduces cognitive load

If motion can be removed without losing meaning, it does not belong.

## Accessibility is the baseline

Accessibility is not a feature here.

Components are:
- Keyboard-first
- Focus-aware
- Predictable in behavior
- Designed to degrade gracefully

If a component is not accessible, it is unfinished.

## APIs should disappear

Good APIs do not draw attention to themselves.

attn/ui favors:
- Small, obvious surfaces
- Opinionated defaults
- Customization without ceremony

If using a component requires reading the documentation twice, the API failed.

## Ownership matters

attn/ui follows the shadcn distribution model.

You own the code.
You can change it.
You are responsible for it.

This encourages understanding over abstraction and learning over consumption.

## Fewer components, higher standards

attn/ui grows slowly by design.

Shipping cadence is irrelevant.
Quality is the metric.

A small set of well-considered components is more valuable than a large set of interchangeable ones.

## A living document

attn/ui will evolve as my taste evolves.

Components may be:
- Refined
- Rewritten
- Removed

This is not instability.
It is honesty.

## An authored collection

attn/ui is a public expression of how I think UI should be built.

Every component is a partial answer.
